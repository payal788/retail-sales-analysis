📝 Project Overview
This project is a Sales Dashboard created in Microsoft Excel to analyze the performance of sales executives across various cities for a coffee sales company. The dashboard provides insightful visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs) to assist in tracking total sales, target achievement percentages, and performance gaps.

📌 Features

📈 Total Sales Summary: Displays the total sales made by each sales executive using tables and bar charts.

🎯 Target Hit %: Shows the percentage of sales targets achieved by each executive via pie chart visualization.

⚠️ Away from Target %: Highlights the performance gap using a labeled bar chart.

📊 Dynamic Visuals: Charts update dynamically based on selected city.
